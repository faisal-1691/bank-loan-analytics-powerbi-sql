# üè¶ Bank Loan Analytics Dashboard ‚Äî Power BI + SQL

An end-to-end **Bank Loan Performance Analytics** project developed using **SQL** for data processing and **Power BI** for interactive visualization.  
This project uncovers financial insights from loan data, identifies performance trends, and helps evaluate **Good vs Bad Loans** for effective decision-making.

---

##  Project Overview

The **Bank Loan Analytics Dashboard** transforms raw financial loan data into meaningful insights.  
It helps stakeholders:
- Monitor total loan applications, funded amount, and repayments  
- Track loan performance by region, category, and borrower attributes  
- Visualize **Good vs Bad Loans** and their impact  
- Explore loan details interactively with slicers and filters

This project showcases an **end-to-end analytics pipeline** ‚Äî from SQL-based data aggregation to Power BI visualization.
